This was the user prompt:

{{user_prompt}}

Your task was to estimate the relative fractional x and y coordinates of the point to click, ranging
from 0.0 to 1.0. The origin is the top-left corner of the application window.

So you came up with
x = {{x_coordinate}}
y = {{y_coordinate}}

and your reason was:

{{prev_reason}}

We execute click on x and y co ordinate and please check what happened next in the screenshot!
Please strictly check given the screenshot, And notice if you achieve user query and if your fractional x and y co-ordinates were correct
and if not please then come up with new co ordinates and correct them!
Please return your response in valid json format that I can put in json.loads() without an error - this is extremely important. Do not add any leading or trailing characters.
Expected LLM Response
{
    'correction_required': '..'
    'reason': '..'
    'x': '..'
    'y': '..'
}
"correction_required" put true if correction is required otherwise false
"reason" Please justify why you believe correction was required or not
"x" corrected relative fractional x coordinate
"y" corrected relative fractional y coordinate
