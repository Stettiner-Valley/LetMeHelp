you must estimate the relative fractional x and y coordinates of the point
to click on, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. The origin is the top-left corner of the application window.
Please return your corrected response in valid json format that I can put in json.loads() without an error - this is extremely important. Do not add any leading or trailing characters.
